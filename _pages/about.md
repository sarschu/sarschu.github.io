Biography
======
I am a computational linguist with a background in the humanities. I studied theatre and media science and German in my bachelor's. Subsequently, I got my master's degree in computational linguistics. I defended my dissertation about NLP methods in the digital humanities in December 2017. Working in the field of digital humanities gives me the great opportunity to combine my interests in computer science with my curiosity about humanities studies. My current research interests are explainability of AI, machine learning, digital humanities and non-standard texts.
I am an expert in working with domain experts, implementing human-in-the-loop solutions for more efficient workflows and more consistent modelling of data, especially in the medical domain.

When I am not working, you find me hiking, climbing, running, cycling ... being outdoors and enjoying the nature in some way.
