<div>
The Interdisciplinary College (IK) is an annual, intense one-week spring school which offers a dense state-of-the-art course program in neurobiology, neural computation, cognitive science/psychology, artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics and philosophy. It is aimed at students, postgraduates and researchers from academia and industry. By combining humanities, science and technology, the IK endeavours to intensify dialogue between the various disciplines. Participants come mainly - but not exclusively - from European countries, lecturers from all over the world. Courses include up-to-date introductions to the main fields of the IK, as well as an in-depth treatment of the focus topic, which is changing from year to year. The IK is also a unique social event. In the long evenings, participants enjoy a very special atmosphere: minds meet, music is played, and friends are made in the welcoming conference site at Lake MÃ¶hne.
