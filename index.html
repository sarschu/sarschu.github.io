						<h2>Who I Am</h2>
					</header>
					<p>My career journey can be encapsulated in one word: transformation. I transitioned from theatre studies to linguistics, from linguistics to artificial intelligence, and from there into management. These shifts were far from predictable, yet each felt like a natural progression. I've lived in five countries, each move spurred by a mix of stagnation and curiosity, turning what could have been restarts into continuous evolution. While the path hasn't always been straightforward, it has taught me a great deal about adaptability, preventing burnout, seeking support, and taking control of my life.</p>
<p>
As a certified <a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/4caf31ed-d148-4ddc-b10b-b70864d790bc">ACC-level coach</a> with the International Coaching Federation, I focus on career and personal development coaching for women in tech and academia. My coaching style is creative and adaptable, incorporating principles of positive psychology, metacognition, and emotional work, with a strong emphasis on co-creating solutions with my clients. Grounding my practice in scientific principles is vital to me: Why does our brain resist change? What role do emotions play in our evolution? How can we motivate ourselves to tackle challenging yet desirable tasks?</p>
<p>
My passion for nature led me from Germany to Ireland, a land of wild, rugged beauty. While I embrace the connectivity of the digital world, I also cherish the power of nature as a co-facilitator in face-to-face coaching sessions.</p>

						<h2>How does coaching work?</h2>
					</header>
					<p>
We all know what a football coach does. But how do you coach someone to improve their overall life success and feeling of achievement? It's not that different! You can train your thinking patterns, your problem-solving abilities, and your perspective on life. It's just practice.</p>

<p>
I am not here to solve your problems for you. As your ally, I am excited to help you solve them yourself. Coaches coach the person, not the problem. I can help you get perspective, train your reframing muscles and at times challenge you to rethink!</p>

<p>Coaching is future-focused: I will help you set your goals, help you understand how to reach them and support you in making sure that you know when you achieved them.</p>
					<p>We will work with real-world situations that you collect from your daily life. We will be detectives together and solve the riddle of how to grow from here. If you want to get a sense for situations in which coaching can help, scroll down!</p>
